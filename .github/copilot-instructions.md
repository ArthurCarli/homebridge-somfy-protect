# Copilot Coding Agent â€“ Onboarding Instructions

## Repository Summary
This repository is a Homebridge dynamic platform plugin written in TypeScript. It integrates Somfy Protect devices with Homebridge, allowing users to control and monitor their Somfy Protect devices via HomeKit.

## High-Level Repository Information
- **Project Type:** Homebridge plugin (Node.js, TypeScript)
- **Languages:** TypeScript (main code), JavaScript (configuration/scripts)
- **Target Runtimes:** Node.js >= 18, Homebridge v1.8.0 or v2.0.0-beta.0
- **Repository Size:** Moderate, standard Homebridge plugin structure

## Build and Validation Instructions
- **Always run `npm install` before any other command.**
- **Build:** `npm run build` (compiles TypeScript, output in dist/)
- **Lint:** `npm run lint` (ESLint, strict configuration)
- **Development:** `npm run watch` (build, link, and run with nodemon)
- **Prepublish:** `npm run prepublishOnly` (runs lint and build)
- **Tests:** No test script defined by default (add if needed)
- **Clean:** `rimraf ./dist` (included in build)
- **Prerequisites:** Node.js >= 18, Homebridge installed locally for development

### Command Sequences
- **Initial Setup:**
  1. `npm install`
- **Build:**
  1. `npm run build`
- **Lint:**
  1. `npm run lint`
- **Development (auto-rebuild):**
  1. `npm run watch`
- **Prepublish Validation:**
  1. `npm run prepublishOnly`
- **Clean Build:**
  1. `rimraf ./dist`
  2. `npm run build`

> **Note:** Always run `npm install` after pulling new dependencies or after a fresh clone. Lint and build must pass before submitting changes. No GitHub Actions workflows are present, but Homebridge plugin standards apply.

## Project Layout and Architecture
- **Root files:**
  - `config.schema.json`: Homebridge config schema
  - `eslint.config.js`: ESLint configuration
  - `LICENSE`: License file
  - `nodemon.json`: Nodemon configuration
  - `package.json`: Scripts, dependencies, metadata
  - `README.md`: Project documentation
  - `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- **src/**: Main source code
  - `index.ts`: Entry point
  - `platform.ts`: Platform logic
  - `platformAccessory.ts`: Accessory logic
  - `settings.ts`: Plugin settings
  - `@types/homebridge-lib.d.ts`: Additional type definitions
- **test/hbConfig/**: Test configuration files
  - `auth.json`, `config.json`: Example/test configs

## Key Dependencies
- `homebridge-lib` (Homebridge utility library)
- Dev dependencies: typescript, eslint, nodemon, rimraf, ts-node

## Pre-Check-in Validation
- Always run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before submitting a pull request.
- Ensure compatibility with Node.js and Homebridge versions as specified in package.json.

## Copilot Agent Validation Policy

- **Unit tests must be run and pass on every validation step.**
- The `test` script in `package.json` must be present and run all tests (e.g., with `vitest run` or equivalent).
- The Copilot agent must always run `npm test` after `npm run lint` and `npm run build` when validating or before submitting any code changes.
- If a GitHub Actions workflow is present, it must include a step to run `npm test` after build and lint.
- If no test script is present, the Copilot agent must add one and ensure tests are executed as part of validation.
- If any test fails, the Copilot agent must not consider the code validated and must fix the issues before proceeding.

> **Summary:** Tests are a required part of the validation process for all code changes. No code is considered validated unless all tests pass.

## Additional Guidance for the Coding Agent
- **Trust these instructions for build, lint, and project structure steps.**
- Only search the codebase if information is missing or appears incorrect.
- Follow the project structure and Homebridge naming conventions.
- All answers and code comments must be in English.

## File Inventory
- **Root:** config.schema.json, eslint.config.js, LICENSE, nodemon.json, package.json, README.md, tsconfig.json
- **src/**: index.ts, platform.ts, platformAccessory.ts, settings.ts, @types/homebridge-lib.d.ts
- **test/hbConfig/**: auth.json, config.json
